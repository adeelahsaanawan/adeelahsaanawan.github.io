        <h1>Sliding Mode Control: An Overview</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Sliding Mode Control (SMC) is a robust control strategy that deals with the uncertainty and disturbances within dynamic systems. Its principle lies in driving the system's state to a predefined sliding surface and maintaining it on this surface despite external disturbances and system parameter variations.

            <h2>Mathematical Formulation</h2>
            <p>
                Consider a general dynamical system described by the following differential equation:
            </p>
            <p>\[
                \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, u)
            \]\</p>
            <p>where</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="important">\(x\)</span> represents the state of the system,</li>
                <li><span class="important">\(u\)</span> is the control input, and</li>
                <li>\(f\) is a function of the system's dynamics.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The goal of SMC is to design a control law \(u\) that forces the system's trajectory to reach and stay on a predefined sliding surface \(S(x) = 0\), where \(S(x)\) is a continuous function of the system state \(x\).
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Design of Sliding Surface</h2>
            <p>
                The sliding surface is designed based on the system's desired dynamics and is given by:
            </p>
            <p>\[
                S(x) = Cx
            \]\</p>
            <p>where \(C\) is a matrix chosen such that the dynamics of the system on the sliding surface have desired properties (e.g., stability, fast response).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Control Law</h2>
            <p>
                The control law in sliding mode control can be defined as:
            </p>
            <p>\[
                u = -k \cdot \text{sign}(S(x))
            \]\</p>
            <p>where \(k\) is a positive constant, and \(\text{sign}()\) denotes the signum function, ensuring the system's trajectory reaches the sliding surface in finite time.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Sliding Mode Control is a powerful control technique for dealing with uncertainties and disturbances in dynamic systems. Its ability to maintain system performance despite external disturbances makes it suitable for a wide range of applications in engineering and science.
